      Bio
    </h2>
    <div class="bio">
        Like the majestic poinsettia, I (Scoobert Doobert) was birthed from the
        sandy soil of Encinitas, California. It’s a rad little beach town, most
        famous for its great surf and fringe- religious communities. One of our
        main beaches, Swami’s, is named after Guru Paramahansa Yogananda. (No, I
        have no idea how to pronounce this.) There’s also a bunch of crazy
        public art. One day a mural of a surfing Madonna appeared on the wall of
        a pizza joint. Another time a lame surfer statue showed up in Cardiff.
        Us Encinitans quickly made the Cardiff Kook our own...<br><br>As a young-gun, I
        played guitar in garages throughout Encinitas. Eventually the cops said
        I needed to stop. There aren’t many practice spaces around here so the
        gang and I would break into churches after hours to jam with their gear.
        We gigged around at schools and coffee shops until my band mates moved
        away for college. I decided to learn to play drums and bass, so I could
        jam with myself. I pretty much just did that for the last five years.
        Blazing, surfing, writing, recording, missing my friends, and wrapping
        burritos (day job). I started digging some of the stuff I was making,
        but still didn’t have a name for the project.<br><br>Then my girlfriend said
        these fateful words, “Did you know Scooby Doo’s real name is Scoobert
        Doobert?”<br><br>I didn’t. It hit me hard. Still reeling from it.<br><br>I named my
        guitar Scoobert Doobert to spread awareness and to honor that most
        genius cartoon. I hope you enjoy its music.
